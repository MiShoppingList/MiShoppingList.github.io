This iOS App is created by Giordano Menegazzi, an individual iOS Developer from the Netherlands. At first the App was designed for personal use, because i needed an app like this myself. I tried multiple different other "similar" apps but was always missing some kind functionality, so i desided to create my own.

Eventually i'm so happy with the result i believe other people could use this app as well, so it's made publicly availbe to use. Obviously it takes some work to built an app like this especially for a standalone iOS developer like me so i implemented Google AdMob to generate somewhat of an income from it.

In the near future i'm planning on integrating an option for premium accounts as well, so you can decide to buy premium and stop seeing advertisements. Next to that i'm also planning on integrating cloudKit support as well, so you can share it with friends and family as well.

If you got other suggestions for new features or found any bugs in the app please don't hesitate to contact me at <mishoppinglist@outlook.com>.



## I hope you enjoy the App!

Greetings, 

Giordano Menegazzi
